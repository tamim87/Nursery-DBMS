# Description
 My project is based on a database management system. <br>
 I am using `Oracle Database 10g XE` which is one of the easiest to store our information. <br>
 The project Nursery Database Management system contains the information of Customers, Plants, payment, order info including plant quantity. <br>

It consists of the following schema: 

# Schema
* <b>`Cust_order`(order_no, amount, order_date)</b>
* <b>`Customer_info`(customer_id, fname, lname, address,email, password, phone, order_no)</b>
* <b>`Payment`(payment_id, customer_id, order_no, payment_date, amount)</b>
* <b>`Plant`(plant_id, plant_name, quantity,price)</b>
* <b>`order_details`(plant_id, quantity, order_no)</b>
